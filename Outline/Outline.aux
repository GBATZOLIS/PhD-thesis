\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces Illustration of a multi-scale diffusion model with three scales. Inspired by multi-scale normalizing flows, this approach diffuses different parts of the image tensor (transformed into multi-level Haar coefficients) at varying speeds. High-frequency detail coefficients diffuse progressively faster, with $d_1$ diffusing faster than $d_2$, $d_2$ faster than $d_3$, and so on, ensuring that all coefficients reach the same (very low) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at their respective terminal diffusion times: $t = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75$, and $1.0$, respectively. The low-frequency approximation coefficients $a_3$ diffuse the slowest, completing their diffusion at $t = 1.0$. The multi-scale structure reduces the dimensionality of the diffusing tensor at each scale, enabling faster computation. Separate neural networks $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ approximate the score functions at different intervals, leveraging the reduced dimensionality of the intermediate distributions. This hierarchical design mirrors the structure of multi-scale normalizing flows, improving training and sampling efficiency while maintaining high image generation quality.}}{3}{figure.caption.4}\protected@file@percent }
